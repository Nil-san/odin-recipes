<h1>About this project</h1>

<p>For this project, I put my initial HTML knowledge into practice by building a basic recipe website.</p> 

<p>The website consists of a main index page with links to three recipe pages: apple pie, buttery garlic green beans, and dry brine turkey. (Yes, I'm also using this project for Thanksgiving dinner prep.)</p>

<h2>Skills demonstrated</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Setting up directories</li>
    <li>Creating absolute and relative links</li>
    <li>Creating ordered and unordered lists</li>
    <li>Using img and anchor tags</li>
    <li>Establishing hierachy with heading tags</li>
